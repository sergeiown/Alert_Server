## Installation

The possibility of fully automated installation has been implemented at the moment. The installer is made in a minimalist version using Batch scripts and PowerShell.

The procedure is as follows:
- download the installer archive `Alert_server_setup.zip` available here: [Alert server releases](https://github.com/sergeiown/Alert_Server/releases);
- extract the installer from the archive to the selected location;
- run the `Alert_server_setup.bat` installer.

The installation will be performed in the location `%userprofile%\Documents\Alert_Server`, during the installation the availability of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) will be checked and installed if necessary.

Actually installation of the local alarm update server consists of importing the project from the [GitHub](https://github.com/sergeiown/Alert_Server) repository and installing the necessary dependencies and shortcuts in the Start menu.

The code is open source, no compiled files are used.

## Usage

Using the local alert update server is surprisingly easy and intuitive. The first run is performed automatically after the installation process is complete.

The status and settings are displayed and managed via the tray icon menu. You can start the server at system startup, select the regions for which alarms will be monitored and so on.

Notifications about the current alert and alert cancellation, as well as saving the alarm history, are provided through the Windows Notification Center using [Snoretoast](https://github.com/KDE/snoretoast). Additionally, alert indication through the tray icon and sound alerts are used. The tray icon menu also allows you to view a map of current alerts [alerts.in.ua](https://alerts.in.ua/).

All actions are recorded in a log file, the size of which is automatically limited to 256 KB, and can be viewed through the tray icon menu.
